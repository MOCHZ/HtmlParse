This is a simple script to fetch files from a website and sorting them into matching catalogs.
Default example uses the www.wherewhywhen.com post containing files from the Ricky Gervais show from XFM.
All MP3 files on in the post will be downloaded to the current directory and sorted into their respective series.

I am in no way responsible for any files downloaded in this example, or any potential breach of potential copyrights
they may be associated with. If you use this code as is, you are solely responsible for any breach of creative or
copyrights you might be engaging in.
